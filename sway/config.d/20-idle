### Idle configuration
#
# Example configuration:
#
exec swayidle -w \
         timeout 60 'swaylock --screenshots' \
         timeout 600 'swaymsg "output * dpms off"' resume 'swaymsg "output * dpms on"' \
         before-sleep 'swaylock --screenshots'
#
# This will lock your screen after 60 seconds of inactivity, then turn off
# your displays after 600 seconds, and turn your screens back on when
# resumed. It will also lock your screen before your computer goes to sleep.
